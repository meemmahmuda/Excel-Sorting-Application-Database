You probably tried to upload a file that is too large. Please refer to documentation for a workaround for this limit. mysql throw this error
ChatGPT said:
That error usually happens when you try to upload a file (like an image, Excel, or SQL dump) into MySQL and it exceeds the allowed size limits set in MySQL or PHP.

Here’s how you can fix it:

1. Check MySQL’s max_allowed_packet
MySQL has a limit for the maximum size of a single query (which includes file data like BLOBs).

Open MySQL configuration file:

Linux:

sudo nano /etc/mysql/my.cnf
or

sudo nano /etc/my.cnf
Windows (XAMPP/WAMP):

C:\xampp\mysql\bin\my.ini
Add or edit:

[mysqld]
max_allowed_packet=256M
Restart MySQL:

sudo service mysql restart
or restart from XAMPP/WAMP control panel.

2. Check PHP limits (if uploading through PHP)
If you’re uploading via PHP (file upload form):

Open php.ini (in XAMPP: C:\xampp\php\php.ini):

upload_max_filesize = 256M
post_max_size = 256M
max_execution_time = 300
memory_limit = 512M
Restart Apache after editing.

3. Check phpMyAdmin limits (if using phpMyAdmin)
phpMyAdmin also inherits PHP limits. If you’re importing a .sql file:

Make sure you edited php.ini as above.

Alternatively, use MySQL command line for large .sql files:

mysql -u username -p database_name < bigfile.sql
4. If you’re inserting BLOBs (like LONGBLOB)
If the file is too big (over 4GB, the max for LONGBLOB), MySQL will fail no matter what.
For very large files, it’s better to store the file on disk and keep only the file path in MySQL.

✅ Quick Fix Summary:

Increase max_allowed_packet in MySQL.

Increase upload_max_filesize and post_max_size in PHP.

Restart services.

For very large files, use CLI or store on disk instead of inside MySQL.

Do you want me to show you step-by-step for XAMPP/WAMP on Windows, or are you running this on Linux server (MySQL + Apache/Nginx)?

The first things to check (or ask your host provider to check) are the values of max_execution_time, upload_max_filesize, memory_limit and post_max_size in the php.ini configuration file. All of these settings limit the maximum size of data that can be submitted and handled by PHP. Please note that post_max_size needs to be larger than upload_max_filesize. There exist several workarounds if your upload is too big or your hosting provider is unwilling to change the settings: how i increase this how much
ChatGPT said:
Good question 👍

Those four PHP settings (max_execution_time, upload_max_filesize, memory_limit, and post_max_size) directly control how big a file you can upload and how long PHP will spend processing it.

Here’s how to choose the right values:

🔑 What each setting does:
upload_max_filesize

Max size of a single uploaded file.

Example: 128M means you can upload files up to 128 MB.

post_max_size

Max size of all data in a single request (including files + form data).

⚠️ Must be bigger than upload_max_filesize.

Example: if upload_max_filesize = 128M, then post_max_size should be 130M or more.

memory_limit

Max memory PHP can use for one script.

Should be larger than both post_max_size and upload_max_filesize.

Example: 512M is usually safe.

max_execution_time

How long (in seconds) PHP can run before timing out.

Default is often 30s, which may be too low for big uploads.

Example: set 300 (5 minutes) or more.

✅ Recommended values for most cases
upload_max_filesize = 128M
post_max_size = 130M
memory_limit = 512M
max_execution_time = 300
👉 If you need bigger uploads, you can go higher, e.g. 512M, 1024M (1G).

⚡ How to apply
Open your php.ini file (location depends on your server: XAMPP/WAMP = xampp/php/php.ini).

Search (Ctrl + F) for each setting and update values.

Save and restart Apache (or Nginx + PHP-FPM) for changes to take effect.

To confirm, create a file info.php:

<?php phpinfo(); ?>
Open it in your browser and check the values.

👉 If you’re on shared hosting and cannot edit php.ini, you can sometimes use:

.htaccess:

php_value upload_max_filesize 128M
php_value post_max_size 130M
php_value memory_limit 512M
php_value max_execution_time 300
Or ini_set() inside PHP (only works for some settings):

ini_set('upload_max_filesize', '128M');
ini_set('post_max_size', '130M');
ini_set('memory_limit', '512M');
ini_set('max_execution_time', '300');
👉 Question for you:
How large is the file you’re trying to upload (in MB/GB)? That way I can tell you exact numbers you should set.

#2006 - MySQL server has gone away
ChatGPT said:
Got it ✅ You’re hitting two separate issues here:

1. Syntax error with SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS
Your query:

SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS = ON;
is invalid.

👉 MySQL does not accept ON/OFF for this. It only accepts 0 (disable) or 1 (enable).

✅ Correct version:

SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS = 1;  -- Enable
SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS = 0;  -- Disable
2. Error #2006 - MySQL server has gone away
This means MySQL dropped the connection, usually because:

Query/file is too big (common during imports).

Timeout expired.

max_allowed_packet too small.

🔧 Fix steps
Edit MySQL configuration (my.cnf or my.ini)

Find and increase:

[mysqld]
max_allowed_packet = 256M
wait_timeout = 28800
Restart MySQL

Linux:

sudo service mysql restart
Windows (XAMPP/WAMP): restart MySQL from control panel.

Retry your import

If using phpMyAdmin and still too big → import with CLI instead:

mysql -u username -p database_name < bigdump.sql
✅ Summary:

Use SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS = 1; (not ON).

Increase max_allowed_packet + wait_timeout in MySQL to prevent "server has gone away".

For large SQL imports, use command line instead of phpMyAdmin.

where i find my.ini
ChatGPT said:
Good question 👍 The my.ini (or sometimes my.cnf) is the MySQL configuration file. Its location depends on whether you’re using XAMPP/WAMP/Standalone MySQL or Linux.

🔎 Where to find my.ini
🖥️ Windows (XAMPP)
Usually here:

C:\xampp\mysql\bin\my.ini
Or:

C:\xampp\mysql\my.ini
🖥️ Windows (WAMP)
Usually here:

C:\wamp\bin\mysql\mysql(version)\my.ini
🐧 Linux
Common paths:

/etc/my.cnf
/etc/mysql/my.cnf
/etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf
You can locate it with:

mysql --help | grep "Default options"
⚡ How to edit
Open my.ini (or my.cnf) in a text editor (Notepad on Windows, nano/vim on Linux).

Look for [mysqld] section.

Add or update values:

[mysqld]
max_allowed_packet=256M
wait_timeout=28800
Save the file.

Restart MySQL (via XAMPP/WAMP control panel or sudo service mysql restart on Linux).

👉 Do you want me to give you the exact edit steps for XAMPP on Windows (with screenshots-like guidance), or are you running this on Linux server?
